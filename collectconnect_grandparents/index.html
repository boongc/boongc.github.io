    <p class="laura2">mothballs—my <a class="grandparents">grandma’s</a> clothes all smell like that stuff. i wasn’t very close to her but when she passed away i got a pair of her pants to keep in memory of her, and the smell immediately transported me to one summer when i slept in my <a class="grandparents">grandparent’s</a> house and the blankets had that same, strangely comforting smell (i didn’t know what it was at the time, but i always associated it with her after that).</p>

    a lot of my clothes (sweatpants and sweaters) used to be my <a class="grandparents">grandparents</a>/parents/older sister, so wearing them makes me think of them… and even though I wear them less now I have a hard time donating because it’s like letting my <a class="grandparents">grandparents</a> go (esp now they are in their 90s and may leave any time soon I wanna preserve any stuff by them as much as possible…..not just items but also when they share stories from their past when they were younger) 
    <br><br>
    OH actually some <a class="music">old Japanese songs</a> are nostalgic for me because my <a class="grandparents">grandpa</a> used to  listen and sing them all the time (stopped when I was in high school cuz of old age, but he kept going for a while for memories and also to exercise his throat) if you want song names I can send you names but yeah back then Japan rule Taiwan so my <a class="grandparents">grandpa</a> speaks Japanese

    I used to watch this TV show with my <a class="grandparents">grandpa</a> when I was in elementary school in taiwan<br><br>

    my <a class="grandparents">grandma</a> was really crafty
    <br> <br>
    when I was younger she made a lot of knit sweaters with animals on them. I remember one with a giraffe. they were itchy but I liked the designs on them. there might have been another one with hippos or something
    <br> <br>
    she knit shoes too apparently but I never saw them
    <br> <br>
    when she lived with us for a while, she’d make these paper diamond sculptures out of cereal boxes and stuff and then would wrap thread around them carefully in a rainbow
    <br> <br>
    and then she would attach them to more strings and beads and things and make these sort of ornate necklaces
    <br> <br>
    I had one and my cousin had one and everyone had one
    <br> <br>
    I think we used to hang them on the door or keep them in this one particular drawer

        gardenias remind me of my <a class="grandparents">gma</a> and the front door of our house, they only bloom once in a while, but when they do my <a class="grandparents">gma</a> would sometimes pick them and bring them into the house or hide them in our <a class="food">lunch boxes</a>.
